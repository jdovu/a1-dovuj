    <!-- Explain the concept of a designated home page and how its name relates to different servers and languages. -->
     <!-- Paragraph 1 explains what index means as it relates to websites and servers. -->
    <p>The concept of a <strong>desginated homepage</strong> on web servers refers to the main page of a website. 
        The homepage is the first page the visitor would and see when they access a website without specifying a specifc page or file name.
        In most web servers, the designated homepage is mapped to the file path at <strong>/index.html</strong>, which is also the root directory of the web application. 
        The index name is widely adopted as the convention for the homepage, 
        serving as the default entry point for websites and directories across different web servers and programming languages.
